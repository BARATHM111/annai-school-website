ORDER BY appliedAt DESC
```

### **Filter by Status:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM student 
WHERE status = ?
ORDER BY appliedAt DESC
```

---

## ✅ **Verification Steps**

### **1. Check API Response**
```bash
# Open browser console
# Go to: http://localhost:3000/admin/students
# Look for:
✅ Fetched X students from MySQL
```

### **2. Check MySQL Directly**
```sql
USE annai_school_db;
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM student;
-- Should match number shown in admin panel
```

### **3. Test Filters**
```bash
# In admin panel:
1. Search for "john" → See matching students
2. Filter Grade "5" → See grade 5 students
3. Filter Status "approved" → See approved only
4. Clear filters → See all students
```

### **4. Test Refresh**
```bash
# 1. Note current student count
# 2. In MySQL, add/update a student
# 3. Click "Refresh from MySQL"
# 4. See updated data
```

---

## 🔒 **Security**

### **Admin Only Access:**
```typescript
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)
if (!session?.user || session.user.role !== 'admin') {
  return { error: 'Admin access required' }
}
```

### **SQL Injection Protection:**
```typescript
// Using parameterized queries
await query('SELECT * FROM student WHERE email = ?', [email])
// NOT: query(`SELECT * FROM student WHERE email = '${email}'`)
```
