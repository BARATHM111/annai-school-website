## 📊 Database Statistics

### Tables Created: 15
- `users` - Core user authentication
- `user_profiles` - Detailed user information
- `applications` - Admission applications
- `application_status_history` - Status tracking
- `students` - Enrolled student records
- `student_documents` - Document verification
- `academic_years` - Academic year management
- `grades` - Grade/class definitions
- `sections` - Class sections
- `enrollments` - Student enrollments
- `news` - News and announcements
- `carousel_images` - Homepage carousel
- `about_content` - About page content
- `file_uploads` - File management

- `audit_logs` - System audit trail

### Relationships: 20+
- One-to-one: User ↔ Profile
- One-to-many: User → Applications, Student → Documents
- Many-to-many: Students ↔ Enrollments ↔ Academic Years

### Indexes: 25+
- Primary key indexes on all tables
- Foreign key indexes for relationships
- Performance indexes on frequently queried fields
- Unique indexes for business constraints

- ❌ Performance issues with large datasets

### After (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
- ✅ Proper data relationships and integrity
- ✅ Strong data validation and constraints
- ✅ Concurrent access with ACID properties
- ✅ Powerful SQL queries and aggregations
- ✅ Automated backup and recovery
- ✅ Excellent performance with indexing
- ✅ Type-safe database operations
- ✅ Real-time data synchronization
- ✅ Scalable architecture

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

```bash
# Database Management
npm run db:generate    # Generate Prisma client
npm run db:push       # Push schema to database
npm run db:migrate    # Create and run migrations
npm run db:seed       # Seed initial data
npm run db:studio     # Open Prisma Studio
npm run db:reset      # Reset database (WARNING: Deletes all data)
