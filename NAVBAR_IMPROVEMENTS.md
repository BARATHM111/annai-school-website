I've cleaned up the navbar layout to fix spacing issues and logo overflow while keeping all existing colors!

- ✅ Reduced text size to prevent overflow
- ✅ Better spacing with `gap-2.5`
- ✅ Tight line height to prevent text overflow

### **2. Improved Navigation Items**

- ✅ Compact padding (px-2.5 py-1.5)
- ✅ Smaller icons (h-3.5 w-3.5)
- ✅ Changed "Application Status" to just "Status" to save space
- ✅ Added `flex-shrink-0` to prevent button squishing

### **4. Better Container Width**
- ✅ Increased max-width to 1400px for more breathing room
- ✅ Better use of horizontal space

### **5. User Avatar & Dropdown**
- ✅ Smaller avatar (7x7 instead of 8x8)
