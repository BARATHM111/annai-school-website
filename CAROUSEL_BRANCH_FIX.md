# ✅ Carousel Branch Isolation - FIXED!

## 🎯 Problem Solved
When you deleted a carousel slide in Tirupur, it was also deleted in Uthukuli branch.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated SQL Migration** ✅
Added `carousel_images` table to the branch migration script:

```sql
-- In: sql/add_branch_id_to_tables.sql
ALTER TABLE carousel_images 
ADD COLUMN branch_id VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'tirupur' AFTER id;
```

### 2. **Updated Carousel API** ✅
File: `src/app/api/carousel/route.ts`

**Changed from:** File-based storage (carousel.json)  
**Changed to:** Database with branch filtering

**All methods updated:**
- ✅ **GET** - Filters by `branch_id`
- ✅ **POST** - Saves with `branch_id`
- ✅ **PUT** - Updates only in current branch
- ✅ **DELETE** - Deletes only from current branch

---

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Run Migration (If Not Done Yet)
```bash
# Add branch_id to all tables including carousel_images
mysql -u root -p annai_school < sql/add_branch_id_to_tables.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Carousel Table
```sql
-- Check if carousel_images has branch_id
SHOW COLUMNS FROM carousel_images LIKE 'branch_id';

-- Check current data
SELECT id, branch_id, title FROM carousel_images;
```

### Step 3: Test
1. **Switch to Tirupur branch**
2. **Upload carousel slide** → Should see in Tirupur only
3. **Switch to Uthukuli branch**
4. **Should NOT see Tirupur slide** ✅
5. **Upload different slide** → Should see in Uthukuli only
6. **Delete Uthukuli slide** → Should NOT affect Tirupur ✅
7. **Switch back to Tirupur**
8. **Tirupur slide still there** ✅

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Before (❌ Problem):
```typescript
// Deleted from file - affected all branches
DELETE FROM carousel.json WHERE id = 'slide-123'
```

### After (✅ Fixed):
```typescript
// Deletes only from current branch
DELETE FROM carousel_images 
WHERE id = 'slide-123' AND branch_id = 'tirupur'

// Uthukuli slides are safe!
```

## 🔍 API Changes Summary

### GET `/api/carousel`
```typescript
// Before: ALL slides
SELECT * FROM carousel_images

// After: Only current branch
SELECT * FROM carousel_images WHERE branch_id = 'tirupur'
```

### POST `/api/carousel`
```typescript
// Now includes branch_id
INSERT INTO carousel_images (id, branch_id, title, ...) 
VALUES (?, 'tirupur', ...)
```

### PUT `/api/carousel`
```typescript
// Only updates in current branch
UPDATE carousel_images 
SET title = ? 
WHERE id = ? AND branch_id = 'tirupur'
```

### DELETE `/api/carousel?id=123`
```typescript
// Only deletes from current branch
DELETE FROM carousel_images 
WHERE id = ? AND branch_id = 'tirupur'
```

## ✅ Verification

After migration, check:

```sql
-- All carousel slides should have branch_id
SELECT branch_id, COUNT(*) as slide_count 
FROM carousel_images 
GROUP BY branch_id;

-- Expected result:
-- tirupur   | 5  (existing slides)
-- uthukuli  | 0  (empty)
```

## 🎯 Summary

**Problem**: Carousel changes affecting all branches  
**Cause**: Using file storage, not database  
**Fix**: Migrated to database with `branch_id` filtering  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  

**All carousel operations now branch-specific!** 🎉
